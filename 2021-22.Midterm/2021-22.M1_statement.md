## Problem 1 (5 puntos)
Implement  a  program  that,  given  (via  command  line)  a  filename,  a  string  and,
optionally, the string MAY (as last argument):
1.  Checks the number of arguments received.
2.  Checks if the file exists and can be read and written. If not, displays an error
message and terminates.
3.  If the user has not entered an additional argument, it will print on the screen
all the lines of the file where the first string appears.
4.  If  the  user  has  entered  MAY,  it  should  print  the  lines where  the  string  is
found  on  the  terminal,  but  all  occurrences  of  the  entered  string  should
appear in upper case.

You can use the function  
`char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle)`  
which looks for the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the larger string
`haystack`. If found, it returns a pointer pointing to the beginning of the substring
found. If not found, it returns a `NULL`.
**Example**. If the content of the file `fich` is:
```
hola Adios
hola holita hola
good bye
```

Example of execution:
```
$ ./find_to_upper fich
Not enough arguments
$ ./find_to_upper fich hola
hola Adios
hola holita hola
$ ./find_to_upper fich hola MAY
HOLA Adios
HOLA holita HOLA
$ ./find_to_upper fich la MAY
HoLA Adios
HoLA holita hoLA
```

## Problem 2 (5 puntos)
Implement a program called one which:
1.  Waits in a loop for SIGTSTP or SIGINT to be received, with the reception
of the latter signal causing the program to terminate.
2.  The program should count the number of SIGTSTPs it receives and if this
number is a multiple of 5, it will send the contents of that counter to process
`two` via a **named pipe**. While sending the contents to process `two`, it shall
ignore any possible arriving signals until the sending finishes.
3.  When it receives SIGINT, it will terminate, but before it terminates, it must
indicate  to process  `two`, through whatever mechanism you decide, that it
must also terminate.
Also implement the program `two` that:
1.  Waits in a loop for the value of the counter sent to it by the process one.
2.  When it has received the data, it will create a new process that executes the
echo command.
    * The command to execute is  
    `echo "The number is: " the ReceivedNumber`
    * The executable of the `echo` command is located in `/bin/echo`
    * The `echo` command will receive two parameters: the string “The
number is:” and another string which should be the transformation
to string of the number received by the named pipe.

3.  When the process `one` tells it to terminate (using the mechanism of your
choice),  it  will  print  out  how  many  numbers  it  has  received  through  the
named pipe.

There is no kindship between processes `one` and `two`, you can use chose
the name of the named pipeline.

**Example of execution of both processes.**

Execution of uno:
```
Ejecución de \uno”:
$ ./uno
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Received 5 SIGTSTP: 5 0
 Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Received 5 SIGTSTP: 10 5
 Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Continue
^Z Received 5 SIGTSTP: 15 10
 Continue
^Z Continue
^C Finishing
$
```

Execution of dos:
```
$ ./dos
The number is: 5
My child 11483 that executed echo has terminated with state 0
The number is: 10
My child 11484 that executed echo has terminated with state 0
The number is: 15
My child 11485 that executed echo has terminated with state 0
I have received 3 numbers
$
```
